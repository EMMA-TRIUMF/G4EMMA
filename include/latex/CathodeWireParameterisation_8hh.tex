\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is a parameterisation that describes a series of cylinders (wires) along X. The cylinders have equal radius and length. They are spaced an equal distance apart, starting from given location. This header file defines variables and functions that are designed to be used in addition to the G4 header file \char`\"{}\-G4\-V\-P\-V\-Parameterisation.\-hh\char`\"{} The file \char`\"{}\-G4\-V\-P\-V\-Parameterisation.\-hh,\char`\"{} in turn, calls upon other headers that detail materials and other technical aspects of parameterizing. Hence this header file adds to the classes and variables already declared in \char`\"{}\-G4\-V\-P\-V\-Parameterisation.\-hh\char`\"{} to suit E\-M\-M\-A's needs. Note\-: this header file also contains a considerable number of dummy classes and functions to get rid of error warnings. (These classes and variables were first introduced in the G4 headers)
